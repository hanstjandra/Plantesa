1. **Start & Timer Check**  
    - The process begins by checking if 30 minutes have passed.  
    - If **NO**, it loops back and waits.  
    - If **YES**, it proceeds to capture new photos.

2. **Photo Capture & Upload**  
    - Capture photos using the camera.  
    - Save the photos locally on the device.  
    - Upload the photos to Firebase Cloud Storage.

3. **Download for Processing**  
    - Download the uploaded photos from Firebase for further analysis.

4. **Image Analysis**  
    - **Greyscale Conversion**: Convert the downloaded image to greyscale.  
    - **Bounding Box Detection**: Detect and mark leaves and brown spots.  
    - **Load Trained Model**: Load a pre-trained machine learning model.  
    - **Prediction**: Use the model to classify the leafâ€™s health or disease.

5. **Labeling & Upload**  
    - Annotate the image with predictions and detected spots.  
    - Save the labeled photos locally.  
    - Upload the labeled images back to Firebase.

6. **End**  
    - The process stops and waits for the next 30-minute interval to restart.
